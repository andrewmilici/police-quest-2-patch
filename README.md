A fan-made quality-of-life and restoration patch for  
**Police Quest II: The Vengeance** (Sierra On-Line, 1988).

## ✨ Features

This patch is a **non-commercial fan project** created as an homage to the original Police Quest 2,

It includes:
- Quality-of-life improvements
- Added easter eggs/jokes
- Bug and logic corrections.
- Gameplay tweaks

A full list of changes can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewmilici/police-quest-2-patch/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). An alternative spolier-free/hint based version can also be found [here](https://github.com/andrewmilici/police-quest-2-patch/blob/main/CHANGELOG_HINTS.md).

## ⚙️ How to use

1. You must own an original copy of **Police Quest II**.
2. Download a copy of the patch files (PatchFiles.zip) from the [Releases](https://github.com/andrewmilici/police-quest-2-patch/releases/latest) page.
3. Extract the files in the zip straight into your Police Quest 2 folder. 

**Note** At this stage, the game is best run using ScummVM. While the game will run using Dosbox or other means, you may encounter the odd "out of heap space" error. These may be addressed in the future. ScummVM will likely warn you that it has detected an unknown game variant, this is normal and you should be able to proceed past this by selecting "Add anyway".
